    "## 1.2 Purpose <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"section_1_2\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The itslive-explorer notebook allows users to explore and visualize worldwide glacier surface velocity using data produced by NASA's JPL autonomous Repeat Image Feature Tracking algorithm (Gardner et al., 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of its high temporal and spatial resolution, ITS_LIVE data amounts to 8+ million NetCDF files (and growing) stored in AWS S3. For the users' convenience, exploration and filtering of this data can be done using an ipyleaflet-based widget that leverages the [ITS_LIVE search API](https://nsidc.org/apps/itslive-search/docs). After relevant data granules for an area are downloaded (for example a glacier of interest), the notebook provides users with an xarray-powered method to build a data cube ready for time series analysis and from which valuable scientific insights can be gathered.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Technical contributions <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"section_1_3\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Demonstration of time series analysis using the ITS_LIVE velocity pairs dataset**\n",
    "  * The main contribution of the notebook is to provide users with a simple, yet powerful, way to access and process glacier surface velocity data. The notebook uses the ITS_LIVE search API to retrieve a list of granules of interest stored on AWS S3. This can be done using the client library or using an ipyleaflet-based widget. The core example of this notebook creates a time series datacube that enables scientists to worry less about data wrangling and more about the science.\n",
    "* **Development of underlying search API that is exposed in the notebook**\n",
    "  * The [ITS_LIVE search API](https://nsidc.org/apps/itslive-search/docs) hosted at NSIDC is a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) application that ingests geojson metadata produced by the autoRIFT processing pipeline, indexes them using PostGIS, and exposes an efficient spatio-temporal searching API.\n",
    "* **Contributing back to the open source community**\n",
    "  * Since a considerable number of glaciers are in polar latitudes, visualization of such glacier boundaries in the common equatorial-centered map projections often lead to distortions and visual overlap/crowding. For this reason we **implemented custom map projections** for the **[ipyleaflet](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet)** map widget. Also, ITS_LIVE wanted to give users who are not familiar with APIs and Python a way to get the information to their machine and begin analyzing, regardless of whether they wish to work locally from a laptop or in the cloud. Using this notebook, a user can search, download, and visualize data without the need to code a single line of Python, or on the other hand, its code and API can be used as a jumping off for developing new or existing workflows for scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 Methodology <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"section_1_4\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Processing \n",
    "\n",
    "ITS_LIVE aims to use a cloud native approach to generate and analyze data. Leveraging the fact that the ITS_LIVE datasets are stored in AWS S3, all the processing occurs on AWS infrastructure using the [hyp3](https://hyp3.asf.alaska.edu/) pipeline developed by the **Alaska Satellite Facility**. A dockerized implementation of autoRIFT is applied to input files in parallel, generating output files which are stored back in S3 along with geojson metadata for each granule.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img alt=\"ITS_LIVE hyp3 pipeline\" title=\"ITS_LIVE hyp3 pipeline\" src=\"img/processing-pipeline.png\" width=\"60%\"/> <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"figure_1\"/>Fig 1.\n",
    "\n",
    " [ITS_LIVE's autoRIFT algorithm](https://github.com/leiyangleon/autoRIFT) can be applied to optical and radar imagery to detect and measure horizontal displacements between features, for example, between two repeat satellite images as a result of glacier flow, sea ice drift, large earthquake displacements, and land slides. Currently we use Landsat optical and Sentinel optical and radar imagery as input sources for glacier velocity extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image pairs collected from the same satellite position (\"same-path-row\") are processed if they have a time separation of fewer than 546 days. This approach was used for all satellites in the Landsat series (L4 to L8). To increase data density prior to the launch of Landsat 8, images acquired from differing satellite positions, generally in adjacent or near-adjacent orbit swaths (\"cross-path-row\"), are also processed if they have a time separation between 10 and 96 days and an acquisition date prior to 14 June 2013 (beginning of regular Landsat 8 data). Feature tracking of cross-path-row image pairs produces velocity fields with a lower signal-to-noise ratio due to residual parallax from imperfect terrain correction. Same-path-row and cross-path-row preprocessed pairs of images are searched for matching features by finding local normalized cross-correlation (NCC) maxima at sub-pixel resolution by oversampling the correlation surface by a factor of 16 using a Gaussian kernel. A sparse grid pixel-integer NCC search (1/16 of the density of full search grid) is used to determine areas of coherent correlation between image pairs. For information on signal identification see the Normalized Displacement Coherence (NDC) filter described in Gardner et al. (2018). Information from the sparse search is then used to inform a dense search for areas with coherent correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fig 2 shows vertical and horizontal pixel displacements being correlated to create a final velocity field shown in units of meters per year.\n",

    "### Granule Search and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The [ITS_LIVE search API](https://nsidc.org/apps/itslive-search/docs) has 2 endpoints to retrieve a list of granules of interest using the OpenAPI specification:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `/velocities/coverage/`\n",
    "    * gets an aggregate by year (a faceted result) of how many granules will be returned given the user's spatiotemporal parameters \n",
    "  * `/velocities/urls/`\n",
    "    * produces a list of S3 file URLs that match the user's spatiotemporal parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.5 Results <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"section_1_5\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "ITS_LIVE seeks to minimize remaining barriers to using satellite observations for cryosphere research. This includes the production, synthesis, delivery and analysis of such data. The project follows an open-source philosophy with open data and code. In the 2 and a half years since its inception, ITS_LIVE has already supported thousands of unique users, provided nearly 10TB of science data and contributed to more than 50 publications. \n",
    "\n",
    "ITS_LIVE's cloud native approach used to create our dataset makes it ready to be scaled to handle the tsunami of remote sensing data NASA and other agencies are projecting to gather in the coming few years. This notebook is presented as a central collaborative access point to get the data and start working on the science right away.\n",

    "\n",
    "The current analysis workflow still relies in a dated \"download and analyze\" paradigm but incorporates ideas and functionality made practical with Pangeo, such as processing the granules on a Dask cluster. A dedicated Dask cluster for our users is out of scope for ITS_LIVE, however it would be straightforward to adapt the current client library and examples to use one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### To-Do:\n",
    "- **1. On demand cube generation(back-end)**: An intermediate step between the current workflow to analyze the velocity granules locally and in the cloud is to implement the data cube generation on the ITS_LIVE back-end. This way the users will only care about downloading the slice of data they need with the variables they need. This sliced cube could also be generated by Harmony at some point, see point no. 4.\n",
    "- **2. Velocity basemap**: the current map widget does not have a basemap that reflects the global velocity mosaics. The trick is to adapt gdal2tiles or something like it to process enough regional maps into a partition that is compatible with NASA GIBS grid definitions(the basemaps used in the widget)\n",
    "- **3. Include elevation change datasets**: Velocity is not the only ingredient scientist need in order to analyze glacier movements, elevation change data is also part of ITS_LIVE but is not yet included on the current notebook. Once we have both datasets, more accurate and interesting analyses will be possible e.g. mass balance trends.\n",
    "- **4. Harmony integration**: [NASA's Harmony](https://harmony.earthdata.nasa.gov/) is NASA's next generation data processing tool that will allow scientists to get subsetted and analysis ready data in cloud data format. Having ITS_LIVE as a Harmony compatible data will close the  cloud native circle stated earlier.\n",
